Turning and turning in the winding gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart: the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed time is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned

I forgot line seven of the poem

I also forgot line eight
